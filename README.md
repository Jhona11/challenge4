Personal Blog Challenge
Overview
This project is aimed at developing a personal blog application tailored for marketing students. The blog serves as a platform to showcase thoughts and experiences. This README file provides an overview of the user story, acceptance criteria, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

User Story
As a marketing student, I want a personal blog so that I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.

Acceptance Criteria
When loading the app, the landing page should contain a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
Upon submitting the form, blog post data should be stored to localStorage.
After form submission, the user should be redirected to the posts page.
If attempting to submit a form without a username, title, or content, a message should prompt the user to complete the form.
The posts page should have a header with a light mode/dark mode toggle and a "Back" button.
Clicking the light mode/dark mode toggle should update the page content's styles accordingly.
Clicking the "Back" button should redirect the user back to the landing page.
The main content should display a list of blog posts pulled from localStorage.
localStorage should contain a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
Each blog entry in the list should display the title, content, and author of the post.
The footer should include a link to the developer's portfolio.
